# Simple Reflow Controller: Electron App

This is a modified version of the [Simple Reflow Server](https://github.com/lukaslaobeyer/simplereflowserver) that uses the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework to nicely package everything you need to control the [electronics.kitchen reflow controller](http://electronics.kitchen/reflow) as an application.
